					By joining the “Competitive” category, participants will stand a
					chance to win attractive prizes and be featured on our daily
					leaderboard on Instagram. However, if that does not appeal to you and
					you simply just want a reason to break a sweat, do participate in our
					“Casual” category instead! Note that ALL participants, regardless of
